The table below describes some of the most common source asset types supported by the **Asset Pipeline** in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** and lists the product assets generated by **Asset Processor** for each source asset type. The table also lists which builders process which source asset types, and the location of those builders. Builders can be located in the O3DE engine code, Gems, or project code.

{{< note >}}
Some source assets are simply copied to the **Asset Cache**, so the product asset type is identical to the source asset type.

## Asset Builders

| Source Asset | Builder | Builder Location | Description  | Product Assets | 
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `.animgraph` | AnimGraphBuilderWorker | [EMotionFX Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/tree/development/Gems/EMotionFX) | [Animation graphs](docs/user-guide/visualization/animation/character-editor/concepts-and-terms) define animation behavior for characters. | `.animgraph` |
| `.attimage`, `.azasset`, `.azbuffer` | Any Asset Builder | [Atom Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/Atom/RPI/Code/Source/RPI.Builders/Common/AnyAssetBuilder.h) | - | Same as input, for example `.attimage` generates an `.attimage` product asset. |
| `.texatlas` | Atlas Worker Builder | [Texture Atlas Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/TextureAtlas/Code/Source/Editor/AtlasBuilderWorker.h) | [Texture atlases](docs/user-guide/interactivity/user-interface/canvases/texture-atlases) are used to reduce draw calls in user interfaces. | `.texatlasidx` and `.streamingimage` |
| `.bmp`, `.dds`, `.exr`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.tiff`, `.tif` | Atom Image Builder | [Atom Gem](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Gems/Atom/Asset/ImageProcessingAtom/Code/Source/ImageBuilderComponent.h) | Processes images for use in O3DE, primarily for use as [Textures](docs/user-guide/assets/texture-settings/texture-assets). | Output depends on settings, but will generally include `.imagemipchain` and `.streamingimage` |

## Copy Jobs

A copy job is used for assets that have no additional processing, and are copied from the source asset to the asset cache. The product asset is identical to the source asset in this case. Copy jobs are defined via settings registry, the engine default copy jobs can be found in [AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.setreg](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/Registry/AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.setreg).

| Source Asset | Description  | Product Assets | 
| - | - | - |
| `.assetinfo` | A sidecar file that contains an asset processing configuration and settings for a source asset. `.assetinfo` files are source dependencies. If a `.assetinfo` file is modified, its corresponding source asset is reprocessed. | `.assetinfo` |
| `.bmp`</br>`.gif`</br>`.jpg`</br>`.jpeg`</br>`.png`</br>`.tga`</br>`.tif`</br>`.tiff` | Image file formats commonly used as textures for materials and UI elements. Image source assets generate a streaming image product asset and might generate several mipmap product assets if mipmap generation is enabled. | `.streamingimage`</br>`.imagemipchain` |
| `.dds` | A specialized compressed image format most often used for normal maps and texture atlases. | `.streamingimage` |
| `.exr` | High dynamic range (HDR) images used for Image Based Lighting (IBL) and skyboxes. HDR image source assets generate a streaming image product asset and might generate several mipmap product assets if mipmap generation is enabled. | `.streamingimage`</br>`.imagemipchain` |
| `.fbx` | A scene file format that stores complete 3D scenes including meshes, skeletons, skin weights, animation, and materials. 3D scene source assets generate various product assets depending on the contents of the source asset and the data specified for processing. 3D scene files usually contain at least one mesh, and each mesh can produce over a dozen product assets including a model, a buffer for each of the model's vertex attributes, materials, and PhysX meshes. | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.actor`</br>`.skinmeta`</br>`.motion`</br>`.pxmesh`</br>`.azmaterial` |
| `.gltf`</br>`.glb` |  An open source scene transport format that stores complete 3D scenes including meshes, skeletons, skin weights, animation, textures, and materials. 3D scene source assets generate various product assets depending on the contents of the source asset and the data specified for processing. 3D scene files usually contain at least one mesh, and each mesh can produce over a dozen product assets including a model, a buffer for each of the model's vertex attributes, materials, and PhysX meshes. | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.actor`</br>`.skinmeta`</br>`.motion`</br>`.pxmesh`</br>`.azmaterial` |
| `.gradimagesettings` | Stores properties and values that define an image gradient. | `.gradimagesettings` |
| `.inputbindings` | Binds input from keyboards, gamepads, touchscreens, and other devices to runtime events. | `.inputbindings` |
| `.material` | Stores the properties and values, including texture assignments, that define the look of a surface for rendering. | `.azmaterial` |
| `.physmaterial` | Stores properties and values that define the physical properties of a surface for simulation. | `.physmaterial` |
| `.postFXLayerCategories` | A list of key value pairs that define layers for Post FX assignments. | `.postFXLayerCategories` |
| `.prefab` | A spawnable asset container that can include entities and/or other prefabs. | `.spawnable` |
| `.scriptcanvas` | A Script Canvas graph created with **Script Canvas Editor**, which is O3DE's visual scripting tool. | `.scriptcanvas_compiled`</br>`.scriptcanvas_fn_compiled`</br>`.luac` |
| `.shader` | A program written in O3DE's shader language, **Amazon Shading Language (AZSL)**, that calculates the shading of a surface. Shader assets are compiled when processed and produce several intermediate files and product assets for each supported target platform. | `.azshader`</br>`.azshadervariant`</br>`.hlsl`</br>`.json`</br> |
| `.stl` | A simple mesh format used in computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printing. Unlike other 3D scene formats, `.stl` assets can only contain a simple model with limited vertex attributes. | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.pxmesh` |
