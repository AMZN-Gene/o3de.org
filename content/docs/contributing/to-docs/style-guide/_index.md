Ready to start contributing to the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) documentation? This style guide will help you prepare, and give you recommendations and guidelines for [submitting documentation](/docs/contributing/to-docs/submit-a-pr). We've made an effort to give as much information as possible to help contibutors when they have a question about writing style, formatting, or the conventions used across our documentation site. If you find guidance that you need but is missing, [file an issue with the D&C SIG](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community) to suggest an improvement.

Following the style guide is the single best way to make sure that contributions to the O3DE documentation get reviewed and merged quickly, but we don't expect every contributor to know every detail. All we ask is that contributors be _familiar_ with the guide and follow it to the best of their ability. Pull request reviews are there to catch any of the most serious style errors in contributions.

## Ideal Traits

What are the ideal traits for Open 3D Engine documentation?

* ✅ **Descriptive active voice** - Do descriptive sentences have a clear *subject* and *action verb*?
* ✅ **Answer the question at hand** - Does the documentation answer a *why*, *how*, or *where* type of question?
* ✅ **Consistency** - Does the formatting of text and style of writing remain *relatively consistent*?
* ✅ **Help the user** - Does the documentation show the user something *meaningful*    ?

## What's in the guide?

* [General guidance](./guidance) - Some guidance on our documentation style, tone, and how to write in an accessible manner. This section of the guide is very _opinionated_, and unlike other parts of the style guide, is applied much more flexibly.
* [Copy rules](./copy) - Copyedit and style rules. Have a _passing familiarity_ with them when contributing, as light copy passes are part of most reviews.
* [Typesetting and Formatting](./format) - Specific rules regarding typesetting on our documentation, such as how to format executable names, file paths, and code blocks. Features available in the variant of Markdown used by the O3DE documentation site are covered here.
* [Frontmatter metadata](./metadata) - Available (and required) information in the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) headers of Markdown files.
* [Shortcodes](./shortcodes) - The shortcodes that we use for the O3DE documentation; Call-out boxes, version numbers, static paths used by O3DE, and other useful tidbits.
* [Including media](./media) - Guidelines for how to submit media (images, video, audio, or assets) as part of documentation.

This guide _isn't_ meant to be an extensive introduction to either [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or the [Hugo site generator](https://gohugo.io/). If you're learning Hugo, you should read [Work with Hugo](/docs/contributing/to-docs/hugo).
