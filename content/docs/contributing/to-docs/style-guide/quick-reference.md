Follow the O3DE Docs Style Guide in your documentation. This ensures that the documentation is consistent and helpful to users. 

| **Language** |  |
| --- | --- |
| [**Write for accessibility**]() | Documentation is written in U.S. English. Use plain and simple words, wherever possible. Break up information into smaller bodies of text. Use headings and a hierarchal structure to organize information. |
| [**Voice and tone**]() | Use active voice and present-tense verbs wherever possible. Be approachable, respectful, and professional.  |
| [**Speak to the user**]() | Refer to the user as "you"; don't use "we". |
| **Clarity and brevity** |
| [**Precise words**]() | Aim to use words with only one definition or the primary definition from a respectable U.S. English dictionary. |
| [**Short and complete sentences**]() | Break up long sentences that have multiple complex clauses into several short sentences to improve readability. Sentences must have a subject, verb, and an object, and must end with punctuation. |
| [**Acronyms, abbreviations, and latin phrases**]() | Write acronyms or abbreviations in their expanded form first, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Don't abbreviate common words or Latin phrases; use the complete word or a similar one.  |
| [**Standard domain or industry terminology**]() | Use terminology that is standard in the domain or industry. If there's ambiguity, then write context to make sure the reader understands the meaning. |
| [**Idioms, slang, colloquialisms, jokes, or jargon**]() | Don't use. These words and phrases may be understood by native U.S. English speakers, but are difficult to translate.  |
| **Formatting** |
| [**Hugo and Markdown**]() | Documentation is written in Markdown (`.md`) files and processed by Hugo. It's primarily formatted using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), with support for in-line HTML. Additional content formatting is configured within the website, such as callout boxes, images, and videos. |
| [**Metadata**]() | Documentation must comply with metadata requirements, including *sectiontitle*, *title*, *description*, and *weight*. |
| [**Topic headings**]() | Section titles must be an H2 (`##`) heading. Subsection titles follow as H3 (`###`) and H4 (`####`) headings.  |
| [**User interface, inputs, and hotkeys**]() | Bold all instances. |
| [**Files, directories, and paths**]() | Use code-style. Provide context on what the path is relative to. When applicable, link to the file in the [o3de repository](https://github.com/o3de/o3de).  |
| [**Applications, Tools, Gems, and components**]() | Bold only the first on-page appearance. Subsequent appearances on the same page remain unformatted.  |
| [**Code, commands, and API objects**]() | Use code-style for commands and API objects. Use code blocks for multiple lines of code. For API documentation, you may need to use advanced formatting -- see [[Formatting for API Documentation]]. |
| [**Terminology**]() | Be consistent in the use of terms. Italicize new terms, and follow with definition. Terminology that's unique to O3DE must be included in the Terminology page.  |
| [**Trademark formatting**]() | Properly format trademark titles and terminology according to its use from the source. Provide a link to the source's relevant material. |
| [**Images**]() | Static images must be `.png` format. Diagrams must be `.svg` format. |
| [**Animated images**]() | Use short videos (of a few seconds) to demonstrate a feature's functionality. Prefer to use `.mp4` files that are less than 512 KB. `.ogg` and `.webm` formats, and up to 1 MB of size are also accepted. `.gif` format is not permitted. |
