Once you have Open 3D Engine (O3DE) installed in your development environment, you are ready to create an O3DE project. Projects define and configure the set of code and assets that make up your game or other application. Projects need a project directory, which can be located anywhere that is convenient to you - within the O3DE directory itself, somewhere else on your computer, or even on a network drive.

## Creating a Project

You will use CMake and the O3DE CMake scripts from the command line to create and register an O3DE project. Typically, to get you started with a common set of features, it's easiest to create your project using the default template that comes with O3DE. This project template specifies a set of Gems that enable these features. Later on, you will learn how to create your own custom project templates.

The topics in this section introduce you to the options available in O3DE for creating projects.
